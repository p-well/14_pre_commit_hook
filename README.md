# Quadratic Equations Solver

This is script for quadratic equations solving with automatic code testing.
Tests are initiated when user tries to commit changes in repository. Failed tests lead to rejected commit.
The commit is enable when only all tests of ```quadratic_equation.py``` are passed.

# Installation and Usage

Simply clone this repository on your local machine using ```git clone https://github.com/p-well/14_pre_commit_hook.git```.<br />

The following files are stored in repository:

 - quadratic_equation.py - Quadratic equations solver
 - tests.py - Scripts for quadratic_equation.py testing
 - pre-commit - file for running autotests, initialized every time when trying to commit changed in repo.

Copy file ```pre-commit``` into directory ```\.git\hooks``` and try to run commit.
